## üîç Abstract

[NEED TO ADD AT THE END!]

## üß≠ Introduction

I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a raw dataset of PGA Tour Golf. The dataset covers all the rounds played by every golfer in all the tournaments held between the professional seasons of 2015 and 2022. My aim for this analysis was to gain insights into which aspects of players‚Äô golf games most impact their performance in tournaments. Additionally, I aimed to identify characteristics of various courses on the PGA Tour schedule, such as determining which courses favor golfers with more course experience and the courses where putting plays a crucial role in contending in the tournament.

### üí° Project Hypotheses
I have several hypotheses for this EDA, including the following:

1. **Hypothesis #1**: When it comes to winning professional golf tournaments, certain aspects of a player‚Äôs game are more essential than others. Specifically, there are particular strokes gained measurements that have a more significant impact on a player‚Äôs overall performance in a tournament.
2. **Hypothesis #2:** Golfers with more course experience will perform better, and there are specific courses on the PGA tour schedule that reward players with the most experience on that course. 
3. **Hypothesis #3:** There are specific courses on the PGA tour schedule in which it is important to be ‚Äúhot with the putter‚Äù (have high strokes gained - putting statistic).

## üß± Explanation of PGA Tour Dataset

### üîó Data Source

The data used for the analysis was initially obtained from [advancedsportsanalytics.com](http://advancedsportsanalytics.com/), which is now offline. However, the dataset is still available thanks to a [Kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com/) user who has uploaded it. The dataset can be accessed through the following link:

### üßπ Data Cleaning Process

Upon my first examination of the dataset, I observed that several of the earlier tournaments lacked strokes gained data. To avoid omitting important data from these tournaments in my analysis of course experience, I decided to create two separate DataFrames for my analysis. One of the DataFrames excluded tournaments without strokes gained information, while the other included a value of 0 for all missing strokes gained data. This way, I could still analyze the other relevant data from those tournaments.

### *Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of Data Cleaning Steps

1. Dropped empty variables
2. Dropped undesired variables
3. Identified and changing identifying variables
4. Addressed missing values in the full dataset
5. Created a new stroked gained DataFrame
6. Created a ‚Äútotal rounds‚Äù and ‚Äúcourse experience‚Äù variables
