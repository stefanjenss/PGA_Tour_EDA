## üîç Abstract

[NEED TO ADD AT THE END!]

## üß≠ Introduction

I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a raw dataset of PGA Tour Golf. The dataset covers all the rounds played by every golfer in all the tournaments held between the professional seasons of 2015 and 2022. My aim for this analysis was to gain insights into which aspects of players‚Äô golf games most impact their performance in tournaments. Additionally, I aimed to identify characteristics of various courses on the PGA Tour schedule, such as determining which courses favor golfers with more course experience and the courses where putting plays a crucial role in contending in the tournament.

### üí° Project Hypotheses
I have several hypotheses for this EDA, including the following:

1. **Hypothesis #1**: When it comes to winning professional golf tournaments, certain aspects of a player‚Äôs game are more essential than others. Specifically, there are particular strokes gained measurements that have a more significant impact on a player‚Äôs overall performance in a tournament.
2. **Hypothesis #2:** Golfers with more course experience will perform better, and there are specific courses on the PGA tour schedule that reward players with the most experience on that course. 
3. **Hypothesis #3:** There are specific courses on the PGA tour schedule in which it is important to be ‚Äúhot with the putter‚Äù (have high strokes gained - putting statistic).
